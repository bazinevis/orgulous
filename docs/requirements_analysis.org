** markup language
org markup is suitable.
i prefer to not have a preview mode. i think it is redundant. instead of preview mode we can use sth like this: for example when we want a italic word we use /italicword/ and the application omits two slashes from the beginning and end of the word but shows it italic. the saved text is "/italicword/" but in the application we can see just italicword which is italic. by moving cursor at the end of word and hitting backspace to remove one character the word becomes /italicword. or by moving cursor at the beginning of the word and hitting delete key the word becomes italicword/. we can do things like this for headings and other text elements too.
** visibility cycling
** Word Count
every user can set a limit on word count or charachter count of notes. this can help them use small and short notes. this feature can be set using template system.
** template system
use template in creating notes. every note can have a different note template. templates can be defined. everytime a note is captured, a template can be selected.
