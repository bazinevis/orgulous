** read & viewed counter
** folder/project view panel
** markup language
org markup is suitable.
i prefer to not have a preview mode. i think it is redundant. instead of preview mode we can use sth like this: for example when we want a italic word we use /italicword/ and the application omits two slashes from the beginning and end of the word but shows it italic. the saved text is "/italicword/" but in the application we can see just italicword which is italic. by moving cursor at the end of word and hitting backspace to remove one character the word becomes /italicword. or by moving cursor at the beginning of the word and hitting delete key the word becomes italicword/. we can do things like this for headings and other text elements too.
** visibility cycling
** Word Count
every user can set a limit on word count or charachter count of notes. this can help them use small and short notes. this feature can be set using template system.
** template system
use template in creating notes. every note can have a different note template. templates can be defined. everytime a note is captured, a template can be selected.

* Architecture
+ modes :: major mode and minor mode
  every buffer has only one major mode and can have multiple minor modes. installing a mode adds some commands to commands list as well as some key bindings to those commands. modes can change look of the buffer like fill mode and syntax highlighting and showing white spaces in the buffer.

  commands can be represented with Command design pattern.

  Every buffer is decorated with chain of responsibilities.

  Every modes for text files do at least three things:
  - font-lock (syntax highlighting)
  - setup syntax table
  - manage indentation
  and probably more, like providing useful key-bindings and interactions with
  other buffers.

  IT MEANS EVERY ASPECT OF A BUFFER IS MANAGED BY MODES.

  Some buffers are not

  A buffer is a Lisp object containing text to be edited. Buffers are used to
  hold the contents of files that are being visited; there may also be buffers
  that are not visiting files(like dired). Although several buffers normally
  exist, only one buffer is designated the current buffer at any time. Most
  editing commands act on the contents of the current buffer. Each buffer,
  including the current buffer, may or may not be displayed in any windows.
  Buffers in Emacs editing are objects that have distinct names and hold text
  that can be edited. Buffers appear to Lisp programs as a special data
  type. You can think of the contents of a buffer as a string that you can
  extend; insertions and deletions may occur in any part of the buffer. See
  Text. A Lisp buffer object contains numerous pieces of information. Some of
  this
information is directly accessible to the programmer through variables, while
other information is accessible only through special-purpose functions. For
example, the visited file name is directly accessible through a variable, while
the value of point is accessible only through a primitive function.

Developing a note-taking application based on Org mode with support for multiple source code formats and personal knowledge management (PKM) is a great idea! Org mode is already a powerful tool, but adding innovative features can make your application stand out. Here are some ideas for innovative features:

### 1. **Unified Code and Note Integration**
   - **Inline Code Execution**: Allow users to execute code snippets directly within the notes. This could be particularly useful for documenting and testing code.
   - **Code Diff Viewer**: Integrate a diff viewer to compare different versions of code snippets within the notes.
   - **Syntax Highlighting and Linting**: Support syntax highlighting and linting for multiple programming languages directly within the notes.

### 2. **Enhanced Knowledge Management**
   - **Graph-Based Knowledge Visualization**: Implement a graph view to visualize relationships between different notes, tags, and code snippets. This can help users see how different pieces of knowledge are connected.
   - **Automatic Tagging and Categorization**: Use natural language processing (NLP) to automatically tag and categorize notes based on their content.
   - **Knowledge Gap Detection**: Analyze the user's notes and suggest areas where more information might be needed, based on the topics they frequently explore.

### 3. **Advanced Search and Retrieval**
   - **Semantic Search**: Implement semantic search capabilities to find notes and code snippets based on meaning rather than just keywords.
   - **Contextual Search**: Allow users to search within specific contexts, such as within a particular project, tag, or date range.
   - **Code Search**: Enable searching for code snippets based on functionality, not just syntax (e.g., "find all code that processes JSON").

### 4. **Collaboration Features**
   - **Real-Time Collaboration**: Allow multiple users to collaborate on the same set of notes and code snippets in real-time, similar to Google Docs.
   - **Commenting and Review**: Add commenting and review features specifically for code snippets, allowing team members to discuss and improve code directly within the notes.
   - **Version Control Integration**: Integrate with Git or other version control systems to track changes to code snippets and notes over time.

### 5. **Task and Project Management**
   - **Enhanced Agenda View**: Expand the agenda view to include more project management features, such as Gantt charts, Kanban boards, and dependency tracking.
   - **Code Task Integration**: Allow users to link tasks directly to code snippets, making it easier to track what needs to be done in a project.
   - **Time Tracking**: Integrate time tracking for tasks and code-related activities, helping users manage their time more effectively.

### 6. **AI-Powered Features**
   - **AI-Assisted Note Taking**: Use AI to summarize long notes, generate outlines, or even suggest related content based on what the user is writing.
   - **Code Completion and Suggestions**: Integrate AI-based code completion and suggestion features directly within the notes.
   - **Automated Documentation**: Automatically generate documentation for code snippets based on comments and notes.

### 7. **Cross-Platform and Cloud Integration**
   - **Cloud Sync**: Offer cloud synchronization to ensure notes and code snippets are accessible across multiple devices.
   - **Cross-Platform Support**: Ensure the application works seamlessly across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) and devices (desktop, mobile).
   - **API Access**: Provide an API for developers to extend the functionality of the application or integrate it with other tools.

### 8. **Customization and Extensibility**
   - **Plugin System**: Allow users to extend the functionality of the application through a plugin system, similar to how Emacs works.
   - **Custom Themes and Layouts**: Offer customizable themes and layouts to suit different user preferences and workflows.
   - **Custom Keybindings**: Allow users to define their own keybindings for frequently used actions.

### 9. **Security and Privacy**
   - **End-to-End Encryption**: Ensure that all notes and code snippets are encrypted, both in transit and at rest, to protect user privacy.
   - **Access Control**: Implement fine-grained access control to allow users to share specific notes or code snippets with specific people.
   - **Audit Logs**: Keep audit logs of changes made to notes and code snippets, so users can track who made what changes and when.

### 10. **Integration with Other Tools**
   - **IDE Integration**: Offer integrations with popular IDEs (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ) to allow seamless switching between coding and note-taking.
   - **API Integrations**: Integrate with other tools like Jira, Trello, or Slack to bring in relevant information directly into the notes.
   - **Export Options**: Provide multiple export options (PDF, Markdown, HTML, etc.) for sharing notes and code snippets outside the application.

### 11. **Learning and Development**
   - **Interactive Tutorials**: Include interactive tutorials to help new users get up to speed with the application's features.
   - **Skill Tracking**: Allow users to track their learning progress, especially for coding skills, by linking notes to specific learning goals or milestones.
   - **Community Features**: Build a community around the application where users can share templates, plugins, and best practices.

### 12. **Accessibility**
   - **Screen Reader Support**: Ensure the application is fully accessible to users who rely on screen readers.
   - **Keyboard Navigation**: Make sure all features can be accessed via keyboard shortcuts for users who prefer not to use a mouse.
   - **High-Contrast Themes**: Offer high-contrast themes for users with visual impairments.

By incorporating these innovative features, your note-taking application can offer a comprehensive solution for both code management and personal knowledge management, making it a valuable tool for developers, researchers, and knowledge workers alike.
